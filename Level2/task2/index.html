    <div class="about">
        <h2 class="biography">Biography</h2>
        <p>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was born on October 31, 1875, in Nadiad, Gujarat, India. He hailed from a humble background and showed early promise in academics. After completing his schooling, he pursued a degree in law in England, where he was deeply influenced by the nationalist movement.

        <br>Upon returning to India, Patel began his legal practice in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, but soon became involved in the Indian National Congress (INC) and the struggle for Indian independence. He quickly rose through the ranks of the Congress due to his organizational skills, leadership qualities, and unwavering commitment to the cause.
            
        <br>Patel played a crucial role in various movements and campaigns, including the non-cooperation movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. He became known as the "Sardar" or leader for his leadership during the Bardoli Satyagraha, a successful civil disobedience campaign against oppressive British land taxes in Bardoli, Gujarat.
            
        <br>One of Patel's most significant achievements came after India gained independence in 1947. As the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of independent India, he was tasked with the monumental challenge of integrating over 500 princely states into the Indian Union. Through a combination of diplomacy, negotiation, and, when necessary, firm action, Patel successfully persuaded the princely states to accede to India.
            
        <br>Patel's efforts in this regard earned him the title of the "Iron Man of India." His vision and determination played a crucial role in preserving the unity and integrity of the newly independent nation.
            
        <br>Sadly, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel passed away on December 15, 1950, but his legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians. He is remembered as one of the architects of modern India, a stalwart leader whose contributions to the nation remain unparalleled.</p>
